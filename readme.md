Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game.
It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board.
It is played using a 15×15 board while in the past a 19×19 board was standard.
Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, gomoku may also be played as a paper-and-pencil game.
The game is known in several countries under different names
